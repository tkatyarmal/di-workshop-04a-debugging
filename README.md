# Debugging workshop

This is a facilitated workshop. You should make notes in here though!

## Get started

Fork & clone the repo like you would with a normal workshop.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adaapp/di-workshop-04a-debugging.git

cd di-workshop-04a-debugging
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:5000/ in your browser and go to the sketch.
